A Lua script for handling HTTP error pages in HAProxy


== Motive

HAProxy does not rewrite error pages returned by backends. The `errorfile`
configuration is used for *errors that are detected by HAProxy*. Of course,
this is well in line with the intended application of HAProxy as a _load
balancer_.

However, in some cases, when HAProxy is serving more than one web application,
you may want to unify the error pages, including HTTP `404`, without creating
redundant content and configuration, or adding another layer to the proxy.


== Usage

Add `error-page.lua` to your HAProxy instance and load it in the `global`
section of `haproxy.cfg`. Then specify your error pages using `errorfile`
keyword.

Note that `404` status code is ignored by HAProxy (you can see it as a
warning during initialization). However, the script still takes note of
it.

[source]
----

global

  lua-load /path/to/error-page.lua
  errorfile 404 /path/to/404.http
  errorfile 500 /path/to/5xx.http

----

Then you can use `lua.error-page` as an action for `http-response` keyword:

[source]
----

frontend

  acl error status ge 400
  http-response lua.error-page if error

----

During the initialization, the script reads `haproxy.cfg`, locates `errorfile`
entries, reads the content of the specified files, and builds a mapping between
status codes and error files content.

Once its action is triggered, it replaces the response from backend with error
page content, given that it could find the status code in the mapping.


== Notes

  - Make sure that your HAProxy instance supports Lua scripting.
  - Make sure that the error page file size does not exceed the configured
    buffer size and does not have reference to local content. See HAProxy
    documentation on `errorfile`.


== Testing

  - Test fixtures are located in `test/` directory.
  - Copy `error-page.lua` to `test/haproxy.conf/scripts`.
  - Compose services, i.e. `docker-compose -p test -d`.
  - Check HAProxy logs, `docker-compose -p test logs -f proxy`.
  - Start testing. `curl -v localhost:8080` must be `200`, every other path
    must return `404` with content of `test/haproxy.conf/errors/404.http`.


== Know Issues

  - Due to {ref02}[major changes in HAProxy API], this script does not work on 1.9+.


== Credits

  - `find_config_file_path` function is adapted from a code snippet in
    {ref01}[this blog post].
